This model, based on the ResNet-150V2 architecture, predicts weather from user-input images using a dataset comprising 6877 images depicting various weather conditions. Experimental evaluations were conducted to assess the performance of the developed weather image recognition system. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, and various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Results demonstrated that the ResNet-150V2-based weather image recognition model achieved high accuracy rates across different weather categories, with precision and recall rates indicating the model's ability to correctly identify specific weather patterns. Training accuracy reached 91%, and validation accuracy reached 87%.
